# What is Lower Bound?
# The lower bound algorithm finds the first or the smallest index in a sorted array where the value at that index is greater than or equal to a given key i.e. x.

# The lower bound is the smallest index, ind, where arr[ind] >= x. But if any such index is not found, the lower bound algorithm returns n i.e. size of the given array.
def lowerBound(arr: [int], n: int, x: int) -> int:
    low = 0
    high = n - 1
    ans = n

    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        # maybe an answer
        if arr[mid] >= x:
            ans = mid
            # look for smaller index on the left
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            low = mid + 1  # look on the right

    return ans
